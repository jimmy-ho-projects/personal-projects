If multiple arduino programs are saved in the same folder, they may
reference each other or some and may not work

see: 

https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=448186.0

Additionally, Arduino program must be
saed with the same name as the FILE that
they are saved in
ex:
Users > Jimmy > Desktop > Arduino_Practice_Programs > Arduino_Practice_Practive.ino
